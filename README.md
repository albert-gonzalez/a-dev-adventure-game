I started this project because I wanted to make an original and unique portfolio, showing some of my skills and explaining my professional experience in a different way. This micro RPG (can be completed in a few minutes) is about my day-to-day professional life, but other people are likely to feel identified. If you play it you will be able to know more about me. I hope you like the game!

You can play the game in three different languages:

- [English](https://albert-gonzalez.github.io/a-dev-adventure-game/)
- [Catalan](https://albert-gonzalez.github.io/a-dev-adventure-game/index.ca.html)
- [Spanish](https://albert-gonzalez.github.io/a-dev-adventure-game/index.es.html)
